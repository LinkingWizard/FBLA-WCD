                <h1>About Us</h1>
                <p>&emsp;Ricchezza is a proud believer in the facts. We won't bore you with the specifics, but we have 12 open restaurants across the country. 5 of which opened only last year! This outmatches our original 9 establishments in the motherland, Italy, and the numbers just keep going up. With our collective staff of over 3,600, the growing number of helping hands lift Ricchezza over the competition and onto higher goals.<br>&emsp;As our great grapevine grows, however, we also pride ourselves in not forgetting our roots. Where we came from and how we got to where we are today are just as important as where we will go in the future. That is why, after all these years, our ideology remains the same. Here at Ricchezza, respect is the most important component in the workplace. Our employees treat each other with patience and an unwavering urge to learn from one another. Our guests are only treated as the highest of class, and yes, the customer is always right. There's a reason we're known as the <i>Golden Heart of Italy</i> after all.<br>&emsp;Anyone with a willingness to do what is necessary for success is welcomed with open arms here on the staff of Ricchezza. The glory of the reasons to join our team only comes second to that of the Roman Gods of old. Frequent vacations and paid time off are only a few to name on our long list of benefits.<br><br>Interested? View the positions and choose what's right for you below.</p>
